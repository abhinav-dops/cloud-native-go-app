# Cloud-Native Go App — Production CI/CD Pipeline

A production-style cloud-native backend application built with **Go**, containerized using **Docker**, and deployed automatically to **AWS EC2** using **GitHub Actions CI/CD**.

This project demonstrates real-world DevOps and backend engineering practices including containerization, automated deployments, infrastructure integration, and service reliability.

This project demonstrates real-world backend engineering practices including:

- Clean architecture (handler → service → repository)

- Containerized deployment

- Database integration

- CI/CD pipeline

- Docker image registry

- Automated cloud deployment

- Infrastructure-level reliability patterns
